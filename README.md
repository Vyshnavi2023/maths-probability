🎲 Maths - Probability
📌 Objective:
Simulate random experiments to estimate and visualize the probability of events using Python. Includes a dice-rolling experiment to observe how experimental probability converges to theoretical probability.

📈 Dice Probability Simulation
Rolls a fair six-sided die 100 times.

Counts how often an even number (2, 4, or 6) occurs.

Calculates probability after each trial.

Plots the estimated probability vs. number of trials.

Demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers — probability stabilizes near the expected value (0.5).

🧠 A Beginner's Guide to Probability
1. What is Probability?
Probability = Likelihood of an event (value between 0 and 1).

P(Event) = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes)

Example:

Rolling a 4 on a die: 1/6

Rolling an even number (2, 4, 6): 3/6 = 0.5

2. Key Terms
Experiment: Activity with uncertain outcome (e.g., rolling a die)

Trial: One repetition of an experiment

Event: A specific outcome (e.g., getting a 6)

Outcome: The result of a trial

Sample Space: All possible outcomes (e.g., {1,2,3,4,5,6})

Equally Likely Outcomes: Each outcome has equal chance

Complementary Events: P(A) + P(not A) = 1

Mutually Exclusive: Events that can't occur together

3. Types of Probability
Classical: Based on theory; equal chances (e.g., coin flip)

Empirical: Based on experiments/data

Subjective: Based on belief or opinion

Axiomatic: Based on formal rules/axioms

4. Probability Formula
P(E) = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes)

Always between 0 and 1

Can be shown as a fraction, decimal, or percentage

5. Real-life Examples
🎯 Picking a blue block (2 out of 6): P = 2/6 = 1/3

🎲 Rolling a 5: P = 1/6

🃏 Drawing a face card: P = 12/52 = 3/13
